We need to change our ways
Doin' the same thing we did yesterday
Making beats, gettin' high
Chasing freaks, feeling fine
It's still the same old shit
(The same old shit)
But I think we ain't gon' quit
Making a rhyme, climbing a hill
Stayin' alive, tryin' to live
(Once in a while,
I get in my head too much)
Just tryin' to live
(And that's when I call,
hoping you appear, God)
That's all it is
Brr, brr
The voice message
Bruh, how the fuck you got so rich and yet,
you wear the same fits
And pair of sneak's like every week?
'Cause I don't care to change shit
I'm like a creature o' habit, plus,
what's the point burnin' bread
When like a creak in yo' attic,
I still be turnin' yo' head?
Just to confirm if that dreadheaded,
tall fella is Cole
I try to walk with the hoodie,
whether the weather is cold
Whether the weather is warm,
it's just to cover the form
When doin' regular things,
try to repel gettin' swarmed
But yesterday, I was drivin',
Trap Muzik album did blast
Took me back to a time
when I was down in my laugh
Was rappin' T.I.P. rhymes,
then I looked down at the dash
Oh shit, I'm trippin', reminiscin',
damn near ran out of gas
I pulled into this lil' station
that I had seen on the ave'
In a peculiar hood,
in unfamiliar paths
I got no hoodie, it's bad,
hopped out and went to the pump
I pushed the 93 button,
felt like a sitting lil' duck
While lookin' over my shoulder,
I heard this dude on the corner
Sound like he talking to me,
"Hey, bro, you smoke marijuana?
I got that pack if you need,
and I can smell the aroma"
I told him, "Nah, I'm aight,
I never once was a stoner"
The tank was taking so long to fill up,
I thought it was broke
Could feel the curiosity comin'
from buddy that spoke
Right then, he start to approach,
"Hey, bro, you look real familiar"
I said, "I get that a lot,",
as he got close, it got clearer
"Oh shit, that's Cole, nigga, wait,
what you doin' over this way?
Bro, I was just thirteen years old
when I got hold of your tape
I tried to put niggas on,
but they was slow to go play
Bro, you the GOAT,
they didn't know then,
but bet they know it today
I need a flick right quick,
'cause, dawg, I don't even know
what to say
To make a dollar bill right now,
I'm out here throwin' bouquets
Slangin' flowers,
but I played your albums
and know it's a way
I played your shit when bro got hit,
it helped me cope with the pain
I played your shit when momma tripped,
and I had nowhere to stay
I swear I feel like you was wit' me
in my loneliest phase"
The love he showed me was so strong,
it damn near blowed me away
See, even I be needin' reminders
on my lowliest day
That I should live in my purpose
if I deliver my verses
And get the fuck out my way,
I'll figure out what to say
Some days, I forget to eat,
some days, I forget to pray
I get a whole lot of love,
some days, I focus on hate
I took a selfie with dawg
and gave the longest embrace
Then look him right in his face
to let him know that this thanks
Was from a genuine place,
'cause this continuous race
To be the best will leave you
steppin' at a strenuous pace
'Til you forget who you is,
and you forget who you ain't
Before you know it you're trapped
inside that picture you paint
This life is more than just rap,
more than the bitches you scrape
More than the riches you stack,
see, it's the difference you make
Yeah, it's the difference you make
Yeah, it's the difference you make
Yeah, it's the difference you-
We need to change our ways,
doin' the same thing we did yesterday
Making beats, gettin' high,
chasing freaks, feelin' fine
It's still the same old shit
(The same old shit),
but I think we ain't gon' quit
Makin' a rhyme, climbing a hill,
stayin' alive, tryin' to live
Just tryin' to live
That's all it is
